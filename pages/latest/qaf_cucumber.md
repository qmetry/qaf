[qaf-cucumber](https://github.com/qmetry/qaf-cucumber#qaf-cucumber) can be used for one of the following cases:

	1. If you want to use cucumber runner instead of TestNG or
	2. If you want to use cucumber step implementation with TestNG runner
	

In either case You can use all the features of QAF along with [BDD2](bdd2.html) and step implementation can be either of [qaf steps](Describe_Test_Step.html) or cucumber steps.
